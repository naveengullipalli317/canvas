   2.1 in this code we have a jQuery () function , ex: $(document).ready(function())
      we will encounter with this error: $ is not defined
      Solution: jquery-plugins.js is developed by using a jquery-3.4.1.min.js script. But, we are trying to load the plugins jquery-plugins.js script first then next loading the core jquery-3.4.1.min.js scripts.
      To avoid the error, we should load the scripts in proper order as below.
      
      <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js"></script>
      <script src="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js"> </script>
